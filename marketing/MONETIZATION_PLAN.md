# CineSnap Monetization & Launch Plan

Based on the **Scientific Entrepreneurship** methodology and **Psychological Pricing** principles.

## 1. Brand Positioning (Scientific Diagnosis)

### The "Brand 3 Questions" Test
1.  **What are you?** (Category)
    *   *Current*: "LUT Preview & Grading App"
    *   *Optimized*: "Professional LUT Manager & Color Grading Tool" (Anchors to "Professional" and "Manager")
2.  **Why buy you?** (Differentiation)
    *   *Core Value*: Speed. Most NLEs (Premiere/DaVinci) are slow for just previewing LUTs. CineSnap is the "Quick Look" for color grading.
    *   *Slogan*: "Grade in seconds, not minutes."
3.  **Why believe you?** (Trust)
    *   *Trust Anchor*: "Built for Filmmakers, by Filmmakers." Showcases real-time performance and support for industry-standard formats key (cube, 3dl).

### Naming Validation: "CineSnap" vs "LUT Studio"
*   **CineSnap**: Stronger.
    *   *Sound Symbolism*: "Snap" (Plosive 'P') implies speed, instant results. "Cine" anchors to Cinema/Professional.
    *   *Memorability*: Easy to spell, suggests "Cinematic Snapshot".
*   **LUT Studio**: Weak. Generic description, not a brand.

## 2. Pricing Strategy (Psychological Anchoring)

### Model: Freemium with "Pro" Unlock
*   **Rational**: Users need to *feel* the speed before paying. A paywall at the start kills the "Quick Look" value proposition.

### Tiers
1.  **Free Tier (The Hook)**
    *   Unlimited LUT preview.
    *   Basic image adjustment.
    *   *Limit*: Watermark on export OR Limit to 5 exports/day.
    *   *Goal*: Establish habit.

2.  **CineSnap Pro (The Profit)**
    *   *Feature*: Batch Export, 3D LUT generation, No Watermark, Unlimited History.
    *   *Pricing*: **$19.99 (One-time)** or **$4.99/mo (Subscription)**.
    *   *Why*: $19.99 is the "Software Sweet Spot" for utility apps. It feels like a "meal" price, not a "software" investment.

## 3. App Store Optimization (ASO)

### Keywords
*   Primary: LUT, Color Grade, Video Editor, Filter, Cinematic.
*   Secondary: DaVinci Resolve, Premiere Pro, Final Cut (competitor anchoring).

### Visuals
*   **Screenshot 1**: Split screen (Before/After) - Shows immediate value.
*   **Screenshot 2**: Grid view of LUTs - Shows quantity/speed.
*   **Screenshot 3**: Export panel - Shows workflow integration.

## 4. Launch Roadmap

1.  **Soft Launch (GitHub)**:
    *   Release `.dmg` to friend/beta testers.
    *   Collect feedback on "Time to First Grade".
2.  **App Store Submission**:
    *   Prepare "Lite" version for review (App Store has strict rules on "demo" modes).
    *   Ensure "Restore Purchase" is rock solid.
3.  **Marketing**:
    *   Post on Reddit (r/filmmakers, r/colorists) as a "Free tool I built because Premiere is too slow".
    *   *Tone*: Humble maker, solving a real pain point.

## 5. Next Steps for Development
- [ ] Implement Watermark for free users.
- [ ] Add "Upgrade to Pro" button in the UI (top right corner, gold color).
- [ ] Integrate App Store / Stripe payment.
